The Blotto game is a two-player strategic game in which players divide a given number of resources, such as soldiers, among several battlefields, with the goal of having more resources on any given battlefield than the opponent. The player with the most soldiers on a battlefield wins that battle and earns a point. The player with the most points at the end of all the battles wins the game. The game is a classic example of resource allocation under competition and illustrates the trade-off between spreading out resources for many smaller victories versus concentrating resources for a few larger victories.

to execute just give the number of soldiers you wish to allocate to both te players.
The following will be calculated for both players : 
* Nash equilibriums 
* Pareto dominants
* Security level
